    <h2>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam – The Missile Man of India</h2>

    <p>
      Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was not just a scientist and former President of India, but a visionary and humanitarian whose life continues to inspire millions. His simplicity, humility, and commitment to national development left a lasting legacy that touches every Indian heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      What I truly adore about Dr. Kalam is his unshakable optimism. Even in the face of challenges, he believed in the power of dreams and hard work. He taught the youth to aim high and work relentlessly to achieve their goals. His speeches were filled with wisdom, but also had a deep emotional connect.

    <p>
      As a scientist, he played a pivotal role in India’s missile and nuclear programs. As a President, he connected with people — especially students — like no one else. He never sought fame, but his character earned him immense respect and love.
    </p>

    <p>
      His book, <em>"Wings of Fire"</em>, has been a guiding light in my life, and every time I read it, I feel a renewed sense of purpose and passion.
